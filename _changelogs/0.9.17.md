## Changes

* __DEPRECATION__ : the previous `dependencies` property is now deprecated. From now on, dependencies should be declared in the `deps` property which has a new syntax, grouped by dependency managers. The syntax will be extended in the near future but in a backward compatible way.
  Supported dependency managers: `brew`, `apt_get` and `check_only` (for checking dependencies which can't be installed automatically, ex the `Xcode.app`).
  Example:

  ```
  - step:
      deps:
        brew:
        - name: cmake
        - name: git
        - name: node
        apt_get:
        - name: cmake
        check_only:
        - name: xcode
  ```
* New command: `stepman collections` prints all the registered Step Lib collections.
* `stepman step-info` output now contains the input `default_value`, `value_options` and `is_expand` values and a couple more useful infos, like `source_code_url` and `support_url` of the Step.
* `stepman step-info` got a new option `--step-yml` flag, which allows printing step info from the specified `step.yml` directly (useful for local Step development).
* log improvements
