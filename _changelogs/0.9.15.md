## Changes

* __New command__ : `stepman step-list` can be used to get a full list of available steps, in a specified library
* New Step property: `asset_urls`, auto-generated into the `spec.json` of the collection if `assets_download_base_uri` is defined in the collection's `steplib.yml`. This can be used to include assets URLs attached to a step, for example icons, primarily for UI tools/websites processing the `spec.json`.
