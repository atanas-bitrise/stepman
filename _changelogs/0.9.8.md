## Changes

* __BREAKING__ : `step.yml` shared in Step Libraries / Step Collections now have to include a `commit` (hash) property inside the `source` property, for better version validation (version tag have to match this commit hash)!
    * You should switch to the new, final default StepLib, hosted on GitHub, which contains these commit hashes and works with stepman 0.9.8! URL: https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise-steplib
    * We'll soon (in about 1 day) start to accept Step contributions to this new StepLib!
* __NEW__ : built in commands to `share` a new step into a StepLib!
* Option to `setup` a local StepLib (use a local path as source instead of a remote git url)
* Delete command : removes the specified collection from the local cache completely.
* Lots of code revision & minor fixes
