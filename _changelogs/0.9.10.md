## Changes

* __FIX__ : if `activate` called with the `--update` flag and the step is not found in the local StepLib collection it'll do an `update` and re-check the step. Now works for both if you specify a version for the step or if you don't (if you use the "latest" version).
* Improved guide for `share`


## Install
